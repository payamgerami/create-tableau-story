## Summary
Titanic was a true tragedy where the majority of the passengers on board perished. However , survival rate varies alot across passenger classes, ticket fare, gender and age. This visualization aims to show different survivle rate among these categories.

## Design
The data I want to encode in the charts includes passenger class, cabins, gender, age groups and whether they survived or perished in this tragedy. Bar charts are a good way to let readers compare different statistics together.


## Feedback
Feedbacks are collected through in person interview and the suggestion for changes are applied.

**Feedback 1** It is easier to compare percentage than raw numbers. So I added pecentege to pie charts.

**Feedback 2** The captions would be better as a story teller rather than just phrases.

**Feedback 3** It would be more undrestandable to show continuous quantitatives on histogram. So I added a histogram showing age distribution and their survival rate.

**Feedback 4** Showing survival as survived or died would be more undrestandable than 0 and 1.

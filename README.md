## Summary
Titanic was a true tragedy where the majority of the passengers on board perished. However , survival rate varies alot across passenger classes, ticket fare, gender and age. This visualization aims to show different survivle rate among these categories.

## Design
The data I want to encode in the charts includes passenger class, cabins, gender, age groups and whether they survived or perished in this tragedy.


## Feedback
Feedbacks are collected through in person interview and the suggestion for changes are applied.
